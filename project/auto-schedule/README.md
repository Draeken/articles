# Value Creation

People need more time to do more things. New products to test and enjoy, there are more and more tasty experience sellers.
Also, for those who wants to do things well, it becomes more complex. There is tons of new books about nutrition, health, personal development. A lot to handle, and for each of these practices, users have to create a habit, change their environment to force them to stick to it...And there is no success guarantee.
People want a way to simplify their life full of goals. They want to conciliate a life of achievments and a life a leasure. They want help to resist of the always growing tempting opportunities of distractions. They want to be free from app hijacking their brain to make them addict.
They want to know the consequences of pursuing a specific goal, potentially conflincting with other goals - what will my life look like? Helping them to select most valuable goals (we can't do everything we want).
How planning can help them ?
It connects primarily to acquire more control of how we consume our time. But all human drives can be reached through agents.

- Involve too much confusion, uncertainty, or complexity.
