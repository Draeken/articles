## Why developping our own UI ?

When I first develop my web app using react, I didn't use any UI library. I didn't want to boilerplate the project. My development goal was a clean and thin project. Back in time I was learning React, and it's a good idea not to add complexity. Eventually, I got a working app without any style, using only HTML vanilla inputs, and I learned the basics of React.
Then I wanted an improved version which I could enjoy using. This would force me to study and apply UX/UI fields, and learn React in-depth. To achieve the improved version, I first start to use material-ui, a library for React featuring lots of components using Google Material design. It went well, but I wasn't satisfied with the customisation and JSS + I wasn't learning that much.

When you use UI libraries, all the complex stuff is already here and your job is only to compose the components, tweak around, use specific fix to these libraries, etc... This way you learn how to use this library but not how it works internaly. And you know it's often a better option to learn the language first rather than framework. The worth thing to do for a JS newbie would be to first start to build a web app using a specific UI library built for a specific framework. Instead, when you start with the language, rewriting existing algotihm, data structure enable you to learn using only what the language offers, focusing you on this rather than a library API. It's only after being comfortable with the language that you can add complexity - standard library, then framework, ... Each layer being built on the previous, simpler one. Building your own UI/route/state management library let you focus solely on React capacities so you can become very comfortable with it (or some sides of it, as these libraries doesn't cover all usage of React, particularly deployment, production code, server side rendering aren't covered, but you can't escape it anyway).

Another pros is controlling the tech stack. Libraries can come with their dependencies that we have to integrate in order to use them with their full potential. When you are building your own lib, you decide what to use, the technologies you are the most comfortable with, etc... It's a real plus because on the long term, when the motivation from the early days evaporated, working with a tech stack you enjoy will help you to keep going.

Last (but not least :), you can build a solution specific for your needs, cutting down boilerplate and package size foundf in general-purpose libraries. You could use cutting-edge techniques to reduce bundle-size, enhance efficiency and so on, because you control the tech stack. Older and widely used libs will surely take a lot of time before using these techniques.
