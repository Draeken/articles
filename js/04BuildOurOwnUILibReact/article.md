## Why developping our own UI ?

When I first develop my web app using react, I didn't use any UI library. I didn't want to boilerplate the project. My development goal was a clean and thin project. Back in time I was learning React, and it's a good idea not to add complexity. Eventually, I got a working app without any style, using only HTML vanilla inputs, and I learned the basics of React.
