# Plan
- Why developping our own UI ?
  - my story
  - to learn
  - control technical stack
  - reduce boilerplate or bundle size
- Design choice
  - How to handle feature addition ?
  - How to handle user customization ?
  - What to support ? device - old browser
- Development with React
  - Comparing approach (consequences):
    - React.Component,
    - HoC,
    - render props,
    - props function
  - Base class with PureComponent: handling theme and default props with emotion
  - Make a responsive theme
  - explain technical choice
  - Handling simple aniamation with react-spring
  - Handling container morphing -> React-morphing (< 400 sloc)
    - issues with it
    - The Morph Issue when animating scale and translate in the same time (solution - matrix!)
