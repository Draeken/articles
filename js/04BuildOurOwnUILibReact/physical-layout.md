Elements included in a physic engine:
- constraint solver
- world
- bodies
- colision, joint, force,

A physical layout would need:
- constraint solver
- world
- simple bodies (1 rectangular shape)
- bodies that can shrink or grow
- colision, force
- different gravity center (potentially moving), or soft joint
- a "stable world" detector -> all velocities = 0
