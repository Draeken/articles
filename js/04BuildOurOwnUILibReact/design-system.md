# Goals & shared values

See: [Purpose, cause, believes](https://github.com/AutoScheduleJS/org/blob/master/README.md#the-purpose-cause--believes)

This design system applies to all tools product helping user managing their time & resources

# Principles:

1. Efficient, that means allow user to use the app as fast as he want. Balance focus on current task & available information that can help performing the current task. Clarity is essential.
2. Try to minimize the time on the app, but don't let user forget it. The magic happens elsewhere.

# Atomic Design

Focus on feature, user action but not entire screen. Then, see what composants are necessary. Atoms are responsive & adaptative. It may includes all necessary information to respond to every cases. Round trip between component detail & whole composition to check if it works well.

Grid system: for each focusable component, we define a set of component to be displayed, and the system automatically place them.
Elements of first importance are centered. Related elements are placed nearby. Elements of second impportance are on the edges, far from center.
