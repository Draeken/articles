# Goals & shared values

See: [Purpose, cause, believes](https://github.com/AutoScheduleJS/org/blob/master/README.md#the-purpose-cause--believes)

This design system applies to all tools product helping user managing their time & resources

# Principles:

1. Efficient, that means allow user to use the app as fast as he want. Balance focus on current task & available information that can help performing the current task. Clarity is essential.
2. Try to minimize the time on the app, but don't let user forget it. The magic happens elsewhere.
