## Dedicate a large space of your best realizations/moment accross time
Then, your eyes will regularly meet your previous best realizations, and you will be motivated to pursue new (or enhance) realization. Realizations could be mixed up into a canvas, to have multiple aspect depicted. It could be across time, with photos of participants. Think about Da Vinci workshop or a Gehn's laboratory in Riven.

## Design your home

## Decoration
### Peinture
Préparation des murs:
 - retirer l'enduit existant
 - enduit pour reboucher les fissures/petits trous
 - poncer
 - aspirer/chiffoner
 - lessivage
Pose de l'enduit (change en fonction de l'enduit utilisé)
Pose de la peinture (A+ pour éviter trop d'émission polluante)
Tadelek: style orientale avec enduit à base de chaux -> sain mais pas très esthétique

## Sain
Contre la pollution intérieur :
 - bien aérer
 - plantes
 - pas de désodorisant -> anesthésie les récepteurs olfactifs


## Smart Home
Dawn simulator -> smart light bulb with program to control it -> RhasberryPie as as home server ? Wifi always on ? :(
put plastic rub around light bulb to project things. (https://www.wikihow.com/Print-Transparencies)
smart mirror
croon or hum -> play music : https://beta.midomi.com/
