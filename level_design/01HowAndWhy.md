Profesionalisation of the level-design work.
Level design is split into more specific job, that can be in one of the two categories:
Gameplay: Foorplan, Script, Events, AI, Story
Visual: Material & Textures, Sound, Lightning, 3D modeling, Effects

Before starting, check the feasibility by comparing key points:
- Time: is there a deadline?
- Limitations: you and your team's skills
- Tech: what tools & engine will you use, what are they capable of?
- Purpose: purpose of the level: to be played in single or multiplayer, final stage, etc
- Requirements: what need to be included?
- Gameplay: how the player will play it
- Theme: atmosphere, architecture, realist or not

Theme & Gameplay are the most flexible and you will want to iterate by changing them until it's clear how it will look and play.
