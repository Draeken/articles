Profesionalisation of the level-design work.
Level design is split into more specific job, that can be in one of the two categories:
Gameplay: Foorplan, Script, Events, AI, Story
Visual: Material & Textures, Sound, Lightning, 3D modeling, Effects

Before starting, check the feasibility by comparing key points:
- Time: is there a deadline?
- Limitations: you and your team's skills
- Tech: what tools & engine will you use, what are they capable of?
- Purpose: purpose of the level: to be played in single or multiplayer, final stage, etc
- Requirements: what need to be included?
- Gameplay: how the player will play it
- Theme: atmosphere, architecture, realist or not

Theme & Gameplay are the most flexible and you will want to iterate by changing them until it's clear how it will look and play.

See the level as a product on the market, to stand out and be noticed.
Use the 80 - 20 rule: complexity != success. Portal game use less than 50 textures!
Don't make original choice only for the purpose of originality, if they aren't perfectly suited with the 7 key points (theme/atmosphere, gameplay, etc). Features that try to make the level standing out must be build on a solid base relying on the 7 key points.

Why would a player choose this level over that level? What does this level offer that that one does not? How does this level add more depth to the game? How does this level promote teamplay, and that level not?

The more an item/bonus is powerful, the more the risk to obtain it should be high.
Depending of the gameplay, light Pick-ups shouldn't need extra move.

Keep the layout simple for new player, not frustrating them, but add extra depth for experienced players that would want to keep playing it.

Concerning singleplayer:
- NPC should be "living in their world", the goal is make the player feeling the world live by itself.
- Reuse area: hub, preview of next area, revisiting altered area
- don't make it predictable
- landmark: use it to help the player know where he is, to remember the place
- interactivity: every bit of interactivity helps removing the static world feeling.
